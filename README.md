# Customer-review-analysis-using-web-scraping-and-NLP
IIn this repository, I will share code for web scraping, preprocessing performed on the web-scraped dataset, and NLP models (VADER and ROBERTA ) deployed on the preprocessed data to find the best product according to the reviews. Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites using automated programs or scripts. The data obtained through web scraping is often in an unstructured or semi-structured format, which requires preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

Preprocessing typically involves tasks such as removing HTML tags, handling missing values, converting text to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase), tokenization (splitting text into words or tokens), removing stop words (common words like "the," "a," "and," etc.), stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root forms), and other data cleaning and transformation steps.

Once the data is preprocessed, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically VADER Sentiment Analysis and ROBERTA Sentiment Analysis, will be applied to analyze and extract insights from the textual data, in this case, product reviews. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based sentiment analysis model that is particularly well-suited for sentiment analysis of social media text. ROBERTA (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach), on the other hand, is a transformer-based language model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.By deploying these NLP models on the preprocessed review data, you can identify patterns, sentiments, and key factors that contribute to determining the best product based on customer reviews.

The code shared in this repository will cover the complete process, from web scraping to data preprocessing and NLP model deployment, providing a comprehensive solution for analyzing product reviews and identifying the best product based on customer feedback.
